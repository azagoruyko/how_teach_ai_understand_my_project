# How to teach AI to understand my project?

That's just my experiments with LLMs to understand better how things work. I constantly used chatgpt and perplexity for helping, but truth be told it's hard to dive into a new topic with all these chat bots, because they give too much information which is not well structured especially for specific level. I had to ask dozens of times the same things trying to figure out why it works like this and always got the same "You're absolutely right...".

## How to use the tutorial
I worked with my custom project which called Rig Builder. That's a tool for making UIs for python scripts. All of the data processed by LLM is saved into the notebook for better understanding the matter.
The best way to follow the tutorial is to use vscode/windsurf/cursor and your own project files.

Just pull the whole repository and open `tutorial.ipynb` in the editor.

## Scheme

That's a basic scheme of how I understand Ollama, FAISS and Langchain.
